                          When I started working on my portfolio site, I honestly had no idea how many errors I was about to face üòÖ. I just wanted a simple website where I could show my projects, skills, and journey as a beginner. But step by step, this project turned into one of my biggest learning experiences.
                          <br/><br/>
                          It took me almost 30 days (yeah, way longer than it should have) because I was learning everything as I went. I built it using Firebase Studio, and I bought my first-ever custom domain from Namecheap for about ‚Çπ300+ ‚Äî that‚Äôs how hariportfolio.xyz was born.

                          The moment I typed hariportfolio.xyz into my browser and saw my site live, it felt amazing üéâ. It wasn‚Äôt just a website ‚Äî it was proof that I could actually build something real on my own. This project gave me confidence, taught me how to face errors without giving up, and reminded me that every beginner has to start somewhere. For me, this portfolio is not just a site ‚Äî it‚Äôs my first step as a developer and a piece of my journey that I‚Äôll always remember.
